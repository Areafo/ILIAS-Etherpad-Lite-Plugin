Etherpad Lite Plugin for ILIAS 4.1 & 4.2:
=========================================

How to install:

1. Install Etherpad Lite according to: https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite

   (please remember to install abiword if you want to enable Word/Openoffice/PDF import/export)
   
2. Copy the file pad.js.sample to "static/custom/pad.js" within your etherpad-lite folder. It removes
   the unnecessary/unused button from the Etherpad Lite control bar

3. Copy the plugin files to Customizing/global/plugins/Services/Repository/RepositoryObject/EtherpadLite/
   in the directory structure of your ILIAS installation

4. Edit the file "etherpadlite.ini.php.sample" and rename it to "etherpadlite.ini.php"


        host = "pad.example.com"
        
        This is the host on which the Etherpad Lite server is running. Please note
        that due to Security restrictions this has to be the same domain as the one
        you're running your ILIAS installation on, or a subdomain thereof.

        So if your ILIAS is running on example.com you can use pad.example.com for
        your etherpad host. No IP address.

        port = "9001"

        Port on which the Etherpad Lite server is listening

        apikey = ""

        You API Key for Etherpad Lite. This is automatically generated when running
        Etherpad Lite for the first time and can be found the the Etherpad Lite directory
        in the file "APIKEY.TXT"

        defaulttext = "Willkommen bei Etherpad Lite .."

        Default Text for an Etherpad

        group = "ilias"

        You can leave this value as is. It just defines an internal group in which 
        Etherpad Lite users are collected.

        domain = ".example.com"

        Set this to to top level domain with a leading dot. This is very important
        for the session cookies to work.

	https = "0"

	Turn https on or of. To use https please set this to "1"

5. Edit the file "libs/etherpad-lite-jquery/js/etherpad.js":

        Find the line 

            'host'		 : 'http://pad.example.com:9001',

        Edit this to match the host and port from the "etherpadlite.ini.php"
        file.

	Also replace the http with https if you're using https

6. Login to your ILIAS installation as a administrator and visit
   Administration -> Modules, Services and Plugins -> Administrate (on the
   "RepositoryObject" row (the second column of that row should already list the
    plugin as "EtherpadLite").

    Click on "Update" and the on "Activate". The plugin should now be available
    and you can start to add Etherpads in you courses. You might need to 
    allow the creation of "Etherpad Lite" objects in your role administration.
