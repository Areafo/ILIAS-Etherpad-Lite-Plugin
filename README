Etherpad Lite Plugin for ILIAS 4.1 - 4.3:
=========================================

If you are using ILIAS 4.1 - 4.2 please use version 0.0.4 or the 'pre-43' branch: https://github.com/jrocho/ILIAS-Etherpad-Lite-Plugin/tags

If you are using ILIAS 4.3 please use version 0.0.5 or the 'master' branch: https://github.com/jrocho/ILIAS-Etherpad-Lite-Plugin/tags



How to install:

1. Install Etherpad Lite according to the instructions at: https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite

   You may use a fork of Etherpad Lite which is a version which has been tested with the
   plugin instead of office Etherpad Lite. 
   
   The fork is available at: https://github.com/jrocho/etherpad-lite
   
   Changes from the main Etherpad Lite will be merged into the fork.

   IMPORTANT: Before you start the Etherpad Lite service turn of "minify" in the settings.json
   otherwise the the JavaScript modifications (see section 2 of this documentation) won't take effect.
   
   Some recommendations on this: place the Etherpad Lite server behind a reverse proxy, move it from 
   SQLite to MySQL, setup an Init script (to start the Etherpad Lite server automatically), install abiword
   for PDF/Word/OpenOffice import/export. Everything is described in the Etherpad Lite wiki on GitHub.

   I've tested this with Debian 5 (using the Debian 6 script) and Debian 6 with nginx and Apache reverse proxy
   setups. 
   
   If you want to only allow access to your pad server to ILIAS user with a session (no direct access to you pad domain)
   set
   
   "requireSession" : true, 
   
   in the settings.json of Etherpad Lite
   
   Set the IP address in the settings.json to 0.0.0.0
   
   e.g.
   
   "ip": "0.0.0.0",
   
   
2. Copy the file pad.js.sample to "static/custom/pad.js" within your etherpad-lite (server) folder. It removes
   the unnecessary/unused buttons from the Etherpad Lite control bar

3. Copy the plugin files to Customizing/global/plugins/Services/Repository/RepositoryObject/EtherpadLite/
   in the directory structure of your ILIAS installation

4. Edit the file "etherpadlite.ini.php.sample" and rename it to "etherpadlite.ini.php"


        host = "pad.example.com"
        
        This is the host on which the Etherpad Lite server is running. Please note
        that due to JavaScript/Cookie security restrictions this has to be the same domain 
        as the one you're running your ILIAS installation on, or a subdomain thereof.

        So if your ILIAS is running on example.com you can use pad.example.com for
        your etherpad host. No IP address.

        port = "9001"

        Port on which the Etherpad Lite server is listening. If you're running a reverse proxy setup
        this will likely be port 80.

        apikey = ""

        You API Key for Etherpad Lite. This is automatically generated when running
        Etherpad Lite for the first time and can be found the the Etherpad Lite directory
        in the file "APIKEY.TXT"

        defaulttext = "Willkommen bei Etherpad Lite .."

        Default text for an Etherpad

        group = "ilias"

        You can leave this value as is. It just defines an internal group in which 
        Etherpad Lite users are collected.

        domain = ".example.com"

        Set this to to top level domain with a leading dot. This is very important
        for the session cookies to work.

		https = "0"
	
		Turn https on or off. To use https please set this to "1"

5. Edit the file "libs/etherpad-lite-jquery/js/etherpad.js":

        Find the line 

            'host'		 : 'http://pad.example.com:9001',

        Edit this to match the host and port from the "etherpadlite.ini.php"
        file.

	Also replace the http with https if you're using https

6. Login to your ILIAS installation as a administrator and visit
   Administration -> Modules, Services and Plugins -> Administrate (on the
   "RepositoryObject" row (the second column of that row should already list the
    plugin as "EtherpadLite").

    Click on "Update" and the on "Activate". The plugin should now be available
    and you can start to add Etherpads in you courses. You might need to 
    allow the creation of "Etherpad Lite" objects in your role administration.
